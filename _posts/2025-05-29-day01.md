**I don‚Äôt know exactly why I started this, but I know one thing I need money.**  
One day, I saw someone make **$3,000 in just 4 hours**. That blew my mind.

Back in the day, I was always super curious.  

In **2007**, I did my first phishing attempt at an internet caf√©  
using the `/etc/hosts` file to mask domains with local IPs.

But that was just something I tried once, out of curiosity.  
Over time, I got deeper into code.  
Now, things are different.  

> Today, I want to focus on one thing: **Bug Hunting**.

This is not just about focusing on that one thing,   
I'm trying something called 'Self-Hacking.'
