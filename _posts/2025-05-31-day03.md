I move that notes from offline to online. 

I may not always find the bug, 
but every failure tells a story worth debugging.

I think this is my first $3000 story about Bug Bounty,
How to achive that? idk. Just focus on the flow and improvment day by day.

I make rules :
1. Dont waster yourtime in tutorial hell that is gimmick > fokus di "live recon", latest “write-up” di medium dll.
2. Find the real one who is the leader in that to see their POV
3. Clear you rattack mapping & make your algorithm to attack
4. Testing until you find that bug
