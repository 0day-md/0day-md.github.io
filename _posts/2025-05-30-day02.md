To Bypass Cloudflare I need to try some method and this artikel help me to look up the map for [Bypass Cloudflare](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/bypass-cloudflare#active-detection-techniques).

I have testing 2 program just flasing, using tools and mapping the flow.

When try to install `MagicRecon` have some problem and it's will repair soon (first thing to solve). I try using Caido but I dont get that feel.
